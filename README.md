Flights
=========================================

My personal attempt to try to work on graph. 
This project is mainly concerned with Data Structures and has a light tough of processing to give some cool data visualization.

When run with Processing, the program will show all the cities based on latitude and longitude.
After that, users can choose an origin and a destination and click on several buttons on top to choose possible routes between these cities.
Options are Direct Flight (shows the price if there's a direct flight between cities); Transit Flight (shows the price with at most 1 transit); Any Route; Shortest Route (Choose the shortest way from a city to another city); Cheapest Route (based on prices in the edges).

====== TO RUN THIS PROGRAM =====
To run this program, you will need to have Processing on Eclipse. The tutorial I used to get Processing on Eclipse IDE was found here: https://processing.org/tutorials/eclipse/

You can then import the project in and run the program from Eclipse IDE.
